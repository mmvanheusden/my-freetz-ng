		vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor. It keeps a log of
		hourly, daily and monthly network traffic for the selected interface(s).
		However, it isn't a packet sniffer. The traffic information is analyzed
		from the proc(5) filesystem. That way vnStat can be used even
		without root permissions.
